# **Alergies**

## Description
Here's something a bit trickier and please only attempt this if you have completed the first two projects and had them both checked by an instructor. An allergy score is a single number that tells what someone is allergic to. The scores for each allergen are:

allergen     score
eggs         1
peanuts      2
shellfish    4
strawberries 8
tomatoes     16
chocolate    32
pollen       64
cats         128
So if someone is allergic to eggs and strawberries, they get a score of 9.

Build a website that uses a method that is called on someone's score - i.e. the score is the object, and returns an array listing what they're allergic to. For example, running allergies(3) should print a list of the person's allergies (eggs and peanuts) to the screen.
